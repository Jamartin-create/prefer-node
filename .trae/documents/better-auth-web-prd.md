## 1. Product Overview
This is a web application built with React and better-auth authentication system. The application provides secure user authentication with username/password login, registration functionality, and user profile management.

The main purpose is to create a modern, secure authentication frontend that integrates seamlessly with the existing better-auth backend service, providing users with a smooth login and registration experience.

## 3. Core Process

### User Authentication Flow
1. User visits the application and is redirected to login page if not authenticated
2. User can either login with existing credentials or navigate to registration
3. After successful login/registration, user is redirected to the user home page
4. User can view their profile information and logout from the home page
5. Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can access the home page
